# Zypherix-OS

> Advanced Operating System based on Cosmos Project. Trying to be linux.

## How it started
I was thinking of making an operating system as a timepass. It was meant to be similiar to linux kernel, almost replicating all commands. Even using the same structure of user management and graphical interfaces like how you use a command to "execute" the window manager/desktop environment.

## What all has been implemented
1. A proper file system
2. Command management
3. Memory leak fixing
4. File System management
5. A somewhat working GUI and cursor without cosmos exploding it in just 5 minutes.
6. A vim based text editor made from scratch, called pedit or "p-edit".
7. Linux-like root and user management
8. (STILL TESTING) Proper argument management with commands

## What all is planned
1. Stable window manager (like the ones that only use keyboard but still have mouse like i3)
2. Perfect keyboard based gui, mouse only to navigate between open window
3. GUI Web Browser
4. Text based browser like links in linux
5. Basic tools available both in GUI and Console (like a full-fledged all in one file manager both for console and gui)
6. Perfect window compositor
7. Actually good scripting language
8. Enable executables and start making a server and package manager to install things including wget.
